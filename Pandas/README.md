# Pandas

_**Pandas** provides powerful data structures (Series & DataFrame) to load, clean, transform, filter, aggregate and
analyze data easily._

### Why Pandas is used?

* makes tabular data handling extremely easy
* faster and more convenient than raw Python lists/dicts for data work
* built on top of NumPy → so performs operations in optimized way
* essential for ML, Data Engineering, EDA, BI etc.

## Pandas Core Features

- **DataFrame**: 2-dimensional labeled data structure similar to SQL tables or Excel sheets.
- **Series**: 1-dimensional labeled data structure used for storing individual columns or arrays.
- **Powerful Indexing & Slicing**: Select, filter, slice rows and columns efficiently using labels or boolean indexing.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, type conversions, renaming columns, replacing values, etc.
- **Data Transformation**: Apply functions, map, apply, vectorized operations, lambda functions for feature engineering.
- **Grouping & Aggregations**: GroupBy operations for summarization, statistical analysis, pivot tables.
- **Merging & Joining Data**: Combine datasets similar to SQL joins (inner, outer, left, right) + concatenation and
  append.
- **Reading & Writing Data**: Import/export data easily from CSV, Excel, JSON, Parquet, SQL databases, etc.
- **Time Series Handling**: Built-in date-time processing, resampling, shifting, window functions.
- **Integration with NumPy / Scikit-Learn**: Pandas acts as the primary data wrangling layer before feeding data into ML
  models.
