# NumPy

_**NumPy** is a Python library used for fast numerical computation and linear algebra operations using multi-dimensional arrays._

# NumPy Core Features

- **ndarray**: Primary N-dimensional array data structure for numerical data.
- **Vectorized Operations**: Perform mathematical operations over entire arrays without explicit Python loops.
- **Broadcasting**: Ability to apply arithmetic between arrays of different shapes intelligently.
- **Universal Functions (ufuncs)**: Fast element-wise operations implemented in C for speed.
- **Linear Algebra Support**: Built-in matrix multiplication, dot product, transpose, inverse, determinant etc.
- **Random Module**: Advanced random number generation, distributions, sampling, seeding.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses contiguous memory blocks; much faster than Python lists.
- **Integration with C/Fortran**: Can interface with low-level languages for optimized numerical computation.
- **Useful Array Manipulation APIs**: reshape, ravel, flatten, split, stack, concatenate etc.
- **Foundation for ML/DS Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow heavily rely on NumPy concepts.
